# Machine-Learning-Codes-during-Learning
I'm learning ML and here are some codes written during this time. (Coursera's courses are just AWESOME!!!!)

1 Linear Regression

One can use this code to see how a basic Linear Regression method simulate the math function you gave.(Such as ordinary ax+b,ax^2+bx+c,sinx/cosx and so on).I also visualized the variation process of machine's parameters during learning to make it clearer.(Surely this makes the traning time much much longer than when there're no visualization)
